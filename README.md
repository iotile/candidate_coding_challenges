# candidate_coding_challenges
Coding exercises for software engineering candidates


## Getting Started

Each folder has a separate exercise.
- `broker`: current broker exercise
- `cloud`: current cloud exercise
- `radiation`: contains a problem based on `coretools` and is for the most part deprecated.

If you are at this level of the repository, make sure you check that you are working on the right exercise!
